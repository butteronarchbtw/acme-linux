personal port of part of the plan9 ecosystem to unix makefiles

this fork contains just enough for building acme and setting a custom font

mainly for educational purposes (and because building plan9port was too slow for me)

all code is taken from [plan9port](https://github.com/9fans/plan9port), please support them if you are interested
